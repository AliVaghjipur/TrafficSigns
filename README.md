"# BehavioralCloning" 
This file contains a Data set of German traffic signs of 42 different classes. 
The data set has been used to train a neural network model in order to be able to classify on its own these traffic signs.
As the data was not sufficient, there has also been some data augmentation done in order to better train the model
